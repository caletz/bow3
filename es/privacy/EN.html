<h3>Our Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>


<h4>Personally Identifiable Information.</h4>

<h4>SNS Accounts</h4>
<p>If you choose to connect your use of the Services with one of your SNS Accounts, such as Facebook, you may have to provide us with your username (or userID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account.

This Log Data includes time spent in our App, frequency of use, and other statistics about usage patterns. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services. We utilize Google Analytics to collect Log Data on our behalf, and Google has its own privacy governing the use of Log Data collected via the Services, accessible at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Membership, Free Trials, Billing and Cancellation</strong></h3>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Membership</strong>
    <ol type="i">
      <li><strong>Ongoing Membership.</strong> Your vodeci membership, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to-month unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the vodeci service. We will bill the monthly membership fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's membership fees to your Payment Method.</li>
      <li><strong>Differing Memberships.</strong> We may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your membership with vodeci by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link. Some promotional memberships are offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Free Trials</strong>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Your vodeci membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. vodeci reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.</li>
      <li>We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly membership fees at the end of the free trial period of your membership unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your membership, including monthly membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click the "View billing details" link on the "Your Account" page. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period.</li>
      <li>You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. CLICK THE "YOUR ACCOUNT" LINK AT THE TOP OF ANY vodeci WEB PAGE (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/">www.vodeci.com</a>) TO FIND CANCELLATION INSTRUCTIONS. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Billing</strong>
    <ol type="i">
      <li><strong>Recurring Billing.</strong> By starting your vodeci membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the vodeci service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including gift card redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you. For members based in Brazil, the membership fees may be adjusted automatically annually, or more frequently as permitted by law, in accordance with the inflation index as established by General Price Index Market published by Fundação Getúlio Vargas ("IGP-M"), or such other index that may be applicable to the vodeci service.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing Cycle.</strong> The membership fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your vodeci membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership. Visit our website and click on the "View billing details" link on the "Your Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle.</li>
      <li><strong>No Refunds.</strong> PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Methods.</strong> You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link, available at the top of the pages of the vodeci website. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your vodeci membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the vodeci service through the end of your monthly billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS OR UNWATCHED MOVIES OR TV SHOWS. To cancel, go to the "Your Account" page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "View billing details" on the "Your Account" page. If you signed up for vodeci using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, and wish to cancel your vodeci membership at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the vodeci service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your vodeci membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.</li>
